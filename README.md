**Project Title:** PC E-Commerce Website

**Description:**
For this project, I developed a fully functional e-commerce website specializing in PC components. The website allows users to browse through a variety of PC hardware and accessories, add items to their cart, and securely complete their purchase using the Razorpay payment gateway. The project was implemented using a combination of PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL for the database management. Additionally, I integrated the Razorpay SDK package and utilized Razorpay APIs to facilitate smooth and secure online transactions.

**Key Features:**

1. **Product Catalog:** Users can explore a diverse range of PC components and accessories, including processors, graphics cards, motherboards, RAM, storage devices, peripherals, and more.

2. **User Authentication:** The website includes user authentication functionality, allowing users to create accounts, log in securely, and manage their profiles.

3. **Shopping Cart:** A user-friendly shopping cart feature enables customers to add desired items, view their selections, and adjust quantities before proceeding to checkout.

4. **Secure Checkout:** Integration with the Razorpay payment gateway ensures a secure and seamless checkout process. Customers can confidently complete their purchases using various payment methods supported by Razorpay.

5. **Order Management:** Once an order is placed, users receive confirmation emails, and their order details are stored in the database for future reference. Registered users can also track their order status through their accounts.

**Technologies Used:**
- **PHP:** Used for server-side scripting to handle dynamic content generation and database interactions.
- **HTML/CSS:** Responsible for structuring the website and styling its elements to enhance the user experience.
- **JavaScript:** Implemented client-side functionalities for interactive features and dynamic page behavior.
- **MySQL:** Employed as the relational database management system to store product information, user data, and order details.
- **Razorpay SDK Package and APIs:** Integrated Razorpay's SDK package and utilized its APIs to enable secure payment processing and transaction management.

**Challenges and Solutions:**
- **Integration Complexity:** Integrating the Razorpay payment gateway required understanding its SDK and APIs thoroughly. I addressed this challenge by studying the documentation carefully and following best practices for integration.
- **Data Management:** Managing product information, user accounts, and order details efficiently posed a challenge. I tackled this by designing an optimized database schema and implementing robust data handling mechanisms.

**Future Enhancements:**
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Implementing features such as product reviews, recommendations, and personalized user interfaces to enhance the overall user experience.
- **Advanced Security Measures:** Incorporating additional security measures, such as SSL encryption, to further enhance the security of online transactions and user data.

**Conclusion:**
Through this project, I gained valuable experience in full-stack web development, database management, and third-party API integration. The PC e-commerce website showcases my proficiency in PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, and the utilization of external APIs to deliver a functional and secure online shopping platform.
